# Four-Step Octaved Sequencer

As featured in the blog post ["Prototype Post-Mortem: Four-Step Octaved Sequencer"](https://blog.tommy.sh/posts/prototype-post-mortem-four-step-octaved-sequencer/), these are the prototype PCB designs for a (yet to be totally finished) fun little noise toy.

The PCB and its electronics are possibly available as a [DIY electronics kit](https://www.oskitone.com/product/four-step-octaved-sequencer-kit). There are 47 components to solder, and it takes about an hour to assemble; it's recommended for those with intermediate soldering experience.

This repo serves as the assembly guide for the kit, as well as the EAGLE project so you can make your own from scratch, should you want to!

Notes:

- Be sure to match polarity on electrolytic caps, diodes, and LEDs! The longer leg of the LED is positive
- The four ICs don't solder directly to the PCB. Instead, solder the included sockets, then insert ICs.
- IC3 may be marked as either CD4040 or MC14040. The two models are pin-for-pin compatible.
- The J1 (on/off) header is included for convenience if you have a switch you'd like to use. If not, short the two pads together.

### Hacking

All done? Try these ideas:

- Swap out for a bigger speaker to really hear the bass
- Increase gain on the [386](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm386.pdf) with a 10uF cap between pins 1 and 8
- Try bigger pots for the step tuners
- Increase R1 for reaaalllly looongggg steeeppsssssssss
- Swap R4-R8 with pots to get individual volume controls for each octave as they mix together
- The [4040](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4040b.pdf) has 12 "octave" outputs but we're only using four...

## Known issues

This PCB was last updated April 2018. In addition to the issues from the [post-mortem](https://blog.tommy.sh/posts/prototype-post-mortem-four-step-octaved-sequencer/):

- Some footprints are slightly mis-sized and require bending leads
- Volume control is linear instead of logarithmic, so range sweep isn't great
- Battery and speaker wires need relief holes to prevent breakage over time

## Version log

- **1.1.2**: Adds IC, header, and polarity labels; reorders octaves
- **1.1.1**: Adds mounting screw holes and a header for on/off switch (not included)
- **1.1**: Initial version featured in the blog post
